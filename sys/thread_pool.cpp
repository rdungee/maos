/**
   Contains implementation of a thread pool. It has the following capabilities:

   1) Maintains pending taskes in a linked list. Wake up idle threads to handle
   them.

   2) Maintains a pool of fixed number of threads. The threads takes jobs from
   the pool and run them. Enters into idle state if no jobs are pending.

   3) When a threads entering into a waiting state, it will go ahead to do other
   jobs and return when the jobs it is waiting for is finished.

   A thread pool is a pool of threads that can be used to run functions without
   spawning/ending a new thread. The threads are created with no job designated,
   but waiting for a condition.
*/
/*
  The jobs are keep in a linked list. thread_pool_queue will queue the jobs to
  the head or end of the list while each thread will remove jobs from the beginning of
  the list when they are waked.  

  2010-12-13: Improved the thread scheduling by test pool->nidle instead of
  pool->jobstail. This reduces the tomography of 100 steps down to 0.65s from
  0.8s for 8 threads at taurus.

  2010-12-16: Do not interrupt a thread and let it do other things. If the
  thread is caught in a mutex locked environment (like malloc/free), there will
  be a deadlock.

  2010-12-25: spin lock is twice as fast as mutex lock. Good for short term locks. 
  2011-01-07: spin lock is not available in MAC. reverted back to pthread.
