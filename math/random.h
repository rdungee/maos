 * In Matsumoto and Nishimura's original paper, the state vector was
 * processed in a forward direction.  I have reversed the state vector
 * in this implementation.  The reason for the reversal is that it
 * allows the critical path to use a test against zero instead of a
 * test against 624 to detect the need to refresh the state.  on most
 * machines, testing against zero is slightly faster.  It also means
 * that a state that has been set to all zeros will be correctly
 * detected as needing initialization; this means that setting a state
 * vector to zero (either with memset or by statically allocating it)
 * will cause the RNG to operate properly.
